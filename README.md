# Jira plugin for Discourse

## What it does

When typing a post with an issue name `(FOO-1234)` or an issue link
`(https://server.tld/browse/FOO-1234)`, the plugin creates a link to the issue
in the format `[FOO-1234](https://server.tld/browse/FOO-1234)`.

## Configuration

The configuration is provided in the Admin / plugins / jira page.
Once enabled, all you need to do is provide URLs to example issues, one for
each project that the plugin should link. These projects can even be on
different servers.

## Installation

See the generic instructions on how to install Discourse plugins. Those are
currently at https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157

Have fun!
